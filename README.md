# About project

[binabilgi.com](https://binabilgi.com/) is an open-source, map-based application that enables people to access the information they need about the earthquake safety status of buildings in order to minimize the damages that may occur in possible earthquakes.

We are developing a spatial database that maps spatial data of different qualities and scales, compiled from different sources on earthquake safety, and presents it to the user in an understandable and traceable manner.
